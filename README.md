## Self Hosting

**PREPARE**

MagLit uses Firebase Firestore as a database. You must first create a new Firebase project, then a file with the name `.env.local` in root directory of the project and fill the details as mentioned in `.env.local.example`.

This step is a **hard requeriment** and any change to this file, **requires a rebuild to the project from scratch** (either through npm install/npm run dev or by using the docker steps)

Clone the project and install dependencies using:

```bash
npm install
```

You need npm or yarn installed for this.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

**DOCKER:**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure the .env.local file is available before the build.

```bash
#  BUILD AND RUN IMAGE USING NPM
npm run docker:build
# RUN IMAGE
npm run docker
# OR RUN IN DETACHED MODE
npm run docker:d
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/xxxxxx](http://localhost:3000/api/xxxxxx). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/xxxxxx.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Read more about [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction).
